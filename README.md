The main objective is to condense all clustering/classification and regression models into toy examples of actual ML Projects. Following a clear Data Science Methodology of Cleaning Data, EDA, Feature Engineering, Creating and Validating the models, and concluding. The first project was a condensation of all the categorization options that exist in the field, tree-based (decision tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and linear-based (SVM, Logistic Regression, OVA); whereas the second presents a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Models for predicting house prices depending on different features.
